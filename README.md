# FlavourAI: Personalized Dish Recommendation System  
*A Data-Driven Approach to Recipe Discovery and Nutritional Insights*  

## Project Overview  
FlavourAI is a personalized **dish recommendation system** that leverages **recipe metadata, user reviews, and ingredient analysis** to provide valuable insights into **food trends, dietary preferences, and cooking behaviors**. This project applies **exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning techniques** to analyze **recipes, reviews, and ingredient pairings** for enhanced food recommendations.
